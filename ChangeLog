2022-01-18  Thorsten Leemhuis <linux [AT] leemhuis [DOT] info>

        * Version 0.9.3
                * new general default 5.15
                * new default for clang13 and gcc12 is 5.15, which both are able to compiled fine, which is not the case for some earlier versions

        * Version 0.9.2
                * clang 12 fails to compile Linux 5.7, hence make it use 5.10 instead and make that the new default

        * Version 0.9.0
                * add '--add-make-args <str>' for peope that want to pass arguments to make
                * enhance README.md a bit and mention requirements

2020-06-05  Thorsten Leemhuis <linux [AT] leemhuis [DOT] info>

        * Version 0.9.0-beta.2
                * make Linux 5.7 the general default and the default for gcc10; that version better supports gcc10 and
                  understands LLVM=1
                * to avoid confusion, split off the rate-run function to kcbenchrate (with its own man page), which is
                  just a symlink to kcbench, but acts differently when called by that name
                * convert man pages to markdown, compiled to proper man pages by the new make target "manpages"
                  (relies on pandoc)
                * kcbenchrate: indicate progress when starting the workers
                * lot's of small fixes and improvements to the man pages

2020-05-05  Thorsten Leemhuis <linux [AT] leemhuis [DOT] info>

        * Version 0.9.0-beta.1
                * switch to 0.9, now that kcbench has nearly all features it IMHO should have
                * support Clang/LLVM
                * support cross compiling
                * support a "rate run" that uses many workers to build a lot of kernels in parallel
                * a few options were renamed to make everything more consistent and easy to use (sorry for the trouble)

2020-04-21  Thorsten Leemhuis <linux [AT] leemhuis [DOT] info>
